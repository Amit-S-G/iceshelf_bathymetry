# Bathymetry Uncertainty Quantification of Various Antarctic Ice Shelves

## Background

Ice shelves play a critical role in stabilizing upstream ice in Antarctica. Many ice shelves in Antarctica are threated by warm waters moving up the continental shelf. The impact that these warm waters have on ice shelf basal melt is believed to be influenced by large bathymetry features below the ice shelves. Sub-ice-shelf bathymetry is usually inferred using airborne gravity data, however previous inversions have not robustly quantified uncertainty in these inverions.

Gravity inversions are non-unique, meaning that there are many different density distributions that can reproduce the observed gravity data. In particular, with poor constraints on sub-ice-shelf geology, it is impossible to know how much of the gravity signal is coming from the general shape of the bathymetry and how much is coming from subsurface density variations. This work use geostatistical simulation to sample this particular uncertainty and produces an ensemble of bathymetry models. We generated ensembled for a variety of ice shelves around Antarctica.
